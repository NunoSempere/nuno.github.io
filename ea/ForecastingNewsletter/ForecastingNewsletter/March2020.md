## Misc.
- [The Brookings institution](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/04/03/forecasting-energy-futures-amid-the-coronavirus-outbreak/), on Forecasting energy futures amid the coronavirus outbreak
- The [European Statistical Service]() is "a partnership between Eurostat and national statistical institutes or other national authorities in each European Union (EU) Member State responsible for developing, producing and disseminating European statistics". In this time of need, the ESS brings us inane information, like "consumer prices increased by 0.1% in March in Switzerland".
- Famine: The [famine early warning system](https://fews.net/) gives emergency and crisis warnings for East Africa.
- COVID: Everyone and their mother have been trying to predict the future of COVID. One such initiative is [Epidemic forecasting](http://epidemicforecasting.org/), which uses inputs from the above mentioned prediction platforms.
- On LessWrong, [Assessing Kurzweil's 1999 predictions for 2019](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GhDfTAtRMxcTqAFmc/assessing-kurzweil-s-1999-predictions-for-2019); I expect an accuracy of between [30% and 40%](https://nunosempere.github.io/rat/KurzweilPredictionsForThe2010s.html), based on my own investigatiobns but find the idea of crowdsourcing the assessment rather interesting.
