Why is this relevant to Effective Altruism? 
- Some items are immediately relevant (e.g., forecasts of famine).
- Others are projects whose success I'm cheering for, and which I think have the potential to do great amounts of good (e.g., Replication Markets).
- The remaining are relevant to the extent that cross-pollination of ideas is valuable. 
- Forecasting may become a powerful tool for world-optimization, and EAs may want to avail themselves of this tool.
