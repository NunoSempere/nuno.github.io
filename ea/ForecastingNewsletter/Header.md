The newsletter itself is experimental, but there will be at least four more iterations. 

Feel free to use this post as a forecasting open thread.

Why is this relevant to Effective Altruism? 
- Some items are immediately relevant (e.g., forecasts of famine).
- Others are projects whose success I'm cheering for, and which I think have the potential to do great amounts of good (e.g., Replication Markets).
- The remaining are relevant to the extent that cross-polination of ideas is valuable. 
- Forecasting may become a powerful tool for world-optimization, and EAs may want to avail themselves of this tool. 

In short, in the words of a sect of the Sith: "Through knowledge, I gain strength; through strength, I gain power; through power, I gain victory. Through victory, my chains are broken."
