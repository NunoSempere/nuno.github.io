# Superpowers I want to have (and the people I want to steal them from)

- Galit: Taking action. Fierce independence.

- Luke: Making friends.

- Mihaly: Having good models.

- Q: Exploiting me when I thought that I was very well calibrated.

- Reka: Being *Nice*.

- Stag: Making themselves big. Controlling narratives. He doesn't know how to control his superpower yet.

- Tina: Being mindful.

- Stan: Being in Control.

- Daystar: Understanding people.

- Owen Shen: Acquiring techniques.

- Tim: Hacking your mind with his voice.

## Superpowers not associated with any particular person

- Quantify.


## Superpowers I think I have

- Knowing when I'm confused.
- Analyze.

Note that I don't really care about whether the people above actually have those superpowers. 
I'm running on narrativomancy here, and want to have a mental picture so that I can ask myself, what would Daystar do?
