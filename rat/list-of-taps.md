- If I notice that smth I read feels important -> then I'll ask myself: "In which real life situations is it important?", and design a TAP to implement the insight
- Juggle when feeling down 
- I notice that a conversation is stalling -> Ask "have you read anything good lately" / "what opinion do you hold which is outside the Overton Window".
- I detect guilt or regret -> Try to rephrase in terms of acquiring information and wisening up.
- Feeling bored -> try to predict what's next and challenge one assumption.
- Notice a category -> Ask yourself whether it's a useful way to chop up reality. 
- I notice the spectific feeling that something is wrong or doesn't make sense -> Say to myself "I notice that I'm confused" -> Stop and think
