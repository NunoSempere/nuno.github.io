# How will I reach Enlightenment?

Healing basking in your love
suddenly stopped,
you were now sunshine to another.

Much pain,
scars remain,
craving intensifies,
harsh words are exchanged.

How will reach Enlightenment?
I vent, I meditate, I contemplate
my own thoughts,
I hack my own brain.

No pain, 
scars fade,
craving diminishes,
and this demeaning 
suffering is gone,
in theory.

But in practice it's much rougher,
in my hero's journey,
I juggle in my bed
when I'm depressed.

Much pain, 
scars fade
craving diminishes,
harsh words are heard.
