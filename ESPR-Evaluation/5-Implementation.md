# Details of the implementation

## Talking with the staff about whether an RCT is a good idea.

Without the support of the staff, an RCT could not go forward. In particular, an RCT will require that we don't accept promising applicants, i.e., from the 2 most promising applicants, we'd want to have 1 in the control group. This to be a forced decision would probably engender great resentment.  

Similarly, though we would prefer to have smaller groups, of 20, we wouldn't have enough power, even after 4 years if we went that route. Instead, we'd want to accept upwards of 32 students (-2 who, on expectation, won't get their visa on time). Other design studies, like ranking our applicants from 1 to 40, taking the best 20 and randomizing the last 20 (10 for ESPR, 10 for the control group) would appease the staff, but again wouldn't buy us enough power.  

If we want our final alumni pool to be equally as good as in previous years, we would want to increase our reach, our advertising efforts say ~3x, i.e., to find 60 excellent students in total, 30 for the control and 30 for the treatment group. This would be possible by, f.ex., asking every previous participant to nominate a friend, by announcing the camp to the most prestigious highschools in countries with a rationality community, etc. An SSC post / banner wouldn't hurt. A successful effort in this area seems necessary for the full buy in of the staff, and might require additional funds.  
  
## Spillovers.

If a promising person from the control group tried to apply the next year, we'd have to deny them the chance to come, or else lose the most promising people from the control group, losing validity.  

We also don't want people on the control group to be disheartened because they didn't get in. For this, I suggest dividing our application in two steps: One in which we select both groups, and a coin toss.  

If people have heard about ESPR, they might read writings by Kahneman, Bostrom, Yudkowsky, et al. If they aren't accepted, they might fulfill their need for cognition by continuing reading such materials. Thus, what we will measure will be the difference between applicants interested in rationality and applicants interested in rationality who go to ESPR, not between equally talented people with no previous contact. At any point, it would seem necessary to disallow explicit mentoring of applicants. Here, again, the full buy in of the staff is needed.  

SPARC is another camp which teaches very similar stuff. I have considered doing the RCT both on ESPR and SPARC at the same time, but SPARC's emphasis on math olympiad people makes that a little bit sketchy. However, because they are still very similar interventions, we don't want to have a person in the control group going to SPARC. This might be a sore point.  

## Stratification.

Suppose that after randomly allocating the students, we found that the treatment group was richer. This would *suck*, because maybe our effect is just them being, f.ex., healthier. In expectation, the two groups are the same, but maybe in practice they turn out not to be.  

An alternative would be to divide the students into rich and poor, and randomly choose in each bucket. This is refered to as stratification, and buys additional power, though I still have to get into the gritty details. I'm still thinking about along which variables we want to stratify, if at all, and further reflection is needed.

Note to self: Paired random assignment might be a problem with respect to attrition (f.ex. no visa on time); JPAL recommends strata of at least 4 people. 

## Measurements

The section of measurements was written by me, Nu√±o, alone. The next step would be to ask, f.ex. the teachers of each class to propose their own measurements, and combine them what we already have. In the case of NVC I have done a small literature review, so this is less vital, but still important.

## Incentives.
The survey takes 15-30 minutes to complete, and while I've tried to make it engaging and propose pauses, I think that an incentive is needed (i.e., the people in the control group might tell us to fuck off). 

I initially thought about donating X USD to the AMF in their name every time they completed a survey, but I realized that this would motivate the most altruistical individuals the most, thus getting selection effects. Now, I'm leaning towards just giving the survey takers that amount of money. 

As a lower bound, 40 people * 3 years * 2 surveys * 10 USD = 2400 USD, or 800 USD/year, as an upper bound, 60 people * 4 years * 4 surveys * 15 USD = 14400 USD or 3600 USD / year. I don't feel this is that significant in comparison to the total cost of the camp. More expensive, I think, is the time which I and others would work on this for free / the counterfactual projects we might undertake with that time. I am as of yet uncertain of the weight of this factor. 

## Take off and burn. 

To end with a high note, there is a noninsignificant probability that the first year of the RTC we realize we've made a number of grievous mistakes. I.e., it would surprise me if everything went without a hitch the first time. Personally, this only worries me if we don't learn enough to be able to pull it off the next year, which I happen to consider rather unlikely. 

If that risk is unacceptable, we could partner with someone like IDInsight, MIT's JPAL, etc. The problem is that those organizations specialize in development interventions. It wouldn't hurt to ask, though.
