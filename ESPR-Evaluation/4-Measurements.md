# Measurements

Note: This is a work in progress. The end result would be to create a several survey such as [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RRKImKZKePSvdWu6aj2zOngSa9PJMfcSH9eCxy3XdfQ/viewform?edit_requested=true), to be taken before the camp, x months after the camp and 2 years after the camp.

## Difficulties

The changes which through ESPR could be induced in the students are, in some sense, fuzzy and soft. There is some tension between measuring what is easiest to measure and measuring what we're actually interested in, and we firmly choose the second kind. For example, when measuring openness, we don't care about questions such as:

I see Myself as Someone Who...
- Is original, comes up with new ideas
- Is curious about many different things
- Is ingenious, a deep thinker
- Has an active imagination
- Is inventive
- Values artistic, aesthetic experiences
- Prefers work that is routine
- Likes to reflect, play with ideas
- Has few artistic interests
- Is sophisticated in art, music, or literature

From John, O. P., & Srivastava, S. (1999). The Big-Five trait taxonomy: History, measurement, and theoretical perspectives. In L. A. Pervin & O. P. John (Eds.), *Handbook of personality: Theory and research* (Vol. 2, pp. 102–138). New York: Guilford Press.

But instead want to ask things such as: 
- What was the last time you tried out something new?
- How often do you try something new?
- How much have you explored vs specialized in the last year?
- What was the last time you did something which you thought had a <=5% chance of succeeding?

Note that the 2015 CFAR Longitudinal study takes a different approach: 
> "We relied heavily on existing measures which have been validated and used by psychology researchers, especially in the areas of well-being and personality. These measures typically are not a perfect match for what we care about, but we expected them to be sufficiently correlated with what we care about for them to be worth using"

For example, they used the questions written above, but they'd be insufficient to capture the effects of CoZE, one of the highest impact activities in a CFAR Workshop.

## Things we want to measure.
**- and ways to measure them.**

Recommend a song which lasts roughly as long as it should take to complete the survey.

Every time you lie or exaggerate, a kitten dies. By answering this survey, you help make the world a better place.

If you find yourself fatigued by the length of the survey feel free to take a break and come back. It is also preferable to just go to the end and turn in what you have. Some questions are
explicitly marked 'bonus' or 'optional' meaning they are especially skippable.

1. Demographic information:
Ask for consent for aggregation / doing a study on this. ✓
Can we include your survey data in a public dataset? ✓
Ask for the email. Followup survey. ✓

Spend about 60 seconds recalling as many examples of these kinds of changes as you can and listing them here. (If you want to skip this question, leave it blank.

- try to think in advance about what obstacles I might face, and how I can get past them.
- seek out information about other people who have attempted similar projects to learn about what they did.
- end up getting it done.
The four items were averaged into a single measure of effective approaches to projects.

1. Probabilities / Calibration.	
- Are you comfortable using probabilities? Do you use them in your daily life / When was the last time you explicitly assigned a probability to something?
- To what extent do you agree with the following: Thinking  in terms of probabilities is a valuable tool in my skill repertoire.
- When was the last time you explicitly assigned a probability to something? Write a short tweet about it.

- "Calibration" is the practice of knowing how certain you are, even when you're not certain. For example, a bookie who says they're 90% certain of the outcome of each of a hundred horse races, and who is right about ninety out of those hundred horse races - is perfectly calibrated. 

In these questions, you will be asked a question and then asked to give a calibration percent. The percent represents your probability that the answer is right. Suppose the question is "What country is the city of Paris located in?" and you are absolutely sure it is France. In that case, your calibration percent is 100 - you are 100% sure it is France. 

But suppose you think there's a fifty-fifty chance it's either France or Germany. In that case, you might still answer France, but your calibration percent is only 50 - you are only 50% sure it's France. 

Or suppose you have no idea, so you pick a country totally at random. In that case, you might think that if there are about one hundred possible countries, and it could be any of them, there's only about a 1% chance you're right. Therefore, you would put down a calibration percent of 1. Please answer on a scale from 0% (definitely false) to 100% (definitely true)

- Are you smiling right now?
- After each question: Without checking a source, estimate your subjective probability that the answer you just gave is correct.-
- Which is heavier, a virus or a prion?
- I'm thinking of a number between one and ten, what is it?
- What year was the fast food chain "Dairy Queen" founded? (Within five years)
- Alexander Hamilton appears on how many distinct denominations of US Currency?
- Without counting, how many keys on a standard IBM keyboard released after 1986, within ten?
	- Too easy to cheat.
- What's the diameter of a standard soccerball, in cm within 2?
- How many calories in a reese's peanut butter cup within 20?
- What is the probability that supernatural events (including God, ghosts, magic, etc) have occurred since the
beginning of the universe?
- What is the probability that there is a god, defined as a supernatural intelligent entity who created the universe?
- What is the probability that any of humankind's revealed religions is more or less correct?
